on retrouv plusieur type de stockage dans l'environement vmware.

    1. Stockage local: kdes disque de stockage interne ou connecter a un systeme de stockage tell qu'un SAS ou SATA 
        it is not a best practice. Using single connections  between storage devices and hosts creates single points of failure (SPOF) that can cause interruptions when a connection becomes unreliable or fails. However, because most of local storage devices do not support multiple connections, you cannot use multiple paths to access local storage. 
        ESXi supports various local storage devices, including SCSI, IDE, SATA, USB, SAS, flash, and  NVMe devices. if you use a cluster of hosts that have just local storage devices, you can implement vSAN. vSAN transforms local storage resources into software-defined shared storage
    
    2. Stockage via le r√©seau: 
        Networked storage consists of external storage systems that your ESXi host uses to store virtual machine files remotely. Typically, the host accesses these systems over a high-speed storage network.
        Networked storage devices are shared. Datastores on networked storage devices can be accessed by multiple hosts concurrently.
